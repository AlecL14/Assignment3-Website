    <h2>IT Technologies</h2>

  <div class="profilesection">
    <h3 class="sectiontitle">CyberSecurity</h3>
      <h3>What does it do?</h3>
        <p>Cybersecurity is defined as the practices that are taken to protect critical IT systems as well as sensitive information from digital threats, such as hacking,
          phishing, scams, etc. As the technological world is constantly evolving every day, so does the risk of attack. Loads of information are being uploaded on the internet,
          which may be prone to unauthorized users performing data breaches to gain access to these information.
        </p>

        <p>Some popular software security risks may include:</p>

        <p><i>Viruses</i> - a type of malicious software that is designed to essentially hijack a series of computer systems by replicating itself and spreading. They often operate by
           acting as a legitimate piece of application when executed will have unexpected and damaging effects to the system, such as corrupting/destroying data, freezing the
           computer, and many more.
        </p>

        <p><i>Ransomware</i> - similar to viruses, ransomware is another type of malicious software designed to hijack computer systems. When a ransomware attack is performed on a system,
           it essentially locks up the files stored in that computer, in order to unlock the files, a “ransom” is required to be paid within a certain time limit or else the files
           will be permanently deleted. In 2021, approximately more than 500 million ransomware attacks were performed, costing around USD$20 billion in damages.
        </p>

        <p><i>Phishing scams</i> - are a way that cybercriminals can steal private, sensitive information (login credentials, banking details, etc.)  from unsuspecting victims.
           Scams of this nature are usually done through emails/messages that pretend to be from a large organization (such as a bank, police, utility companies) to make it more
           believable. It can be easy to identify phishing emails as spelling errors, formatting errors may be present which would not be on a genuine email. If you do not know
           whether an email is real or a scam, the best course of action would be to physically contact the organization who seemingly sent the message in order to confirm with them.
        </p>

        <p><i>Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) Attack</i> - is a malicious attempt to disrupt internet traffic, through overwhelming it with networks of Internet-connected machines.
           In real world terms, a DDOS Attack can be comparable to hundreds of cars intentionally causing a traffic jam on a highway. A victim’s IP address can be exposed and targeted by
           a botnet and sends lots of requests to that respective IP, causing the server to crash. A notorious example of a DDOS attack was when an internet alias named “MafiaBoy” brought
           down the biggest websites (Amazon, Yahoo, eBay) in February, 2000. Overall, the attack caused over $1 billion in damages internationally.
        </p>

        <p>Some ways to protect from security risks is to invest in cybersecurity measures such as:</p>

        <p><i>Anti Viruses</i> - such as Windows Defender, Norton Security, McAfee, etc. can help protect your computer against malware by providing real-time protection through constantly
           scanning files stored on the system, and removing any suspicious software.
        </p>

        <p><i>Multi factor authentication</i> - where a user cannot access a certain application/software with just the login credentials alone, they will need multiple other pieces of
           evidence that prove that they are the true owner of that account. This can be done through sending a PIN code to a mobile number or email, asking security questions that only
           the owner will know, or even using an authenticator app such as Google which generates verification codes every few minutes to avoid unauthorized logins.
        </p>

      <h3>What is the likely impact?</h3>
        <p>As technology is becoming more and more relevant and integrated into our lives, we can often find ourselves being overly dependent on it, transacting with banks online,
           storing sensitive information (such as login credentials to various sites) in password managers and many more. However, while it may make our lives easier, it can also
           leave our information vulnerable to risks and threats. Therefore, it is important to make cybersecurity one’s top priority when interacting with anything online.
        </p>

        <p>Nowadays, a lack of awareness about the internet is oftentimes the result of data being breached. On average, a single data breach for an organization will cost around
          $3 million, through lost revenue, a negative public reputation, and most importantly, loss of customers’ reliability on the company. This means that cybersecurity is
          something that businesses cannot afford to ignore, and should aim to educate their staff on the matter and implement measures to prevent future attacks.
        </p>

        <p>It is estimated that the average business will invest between 6 to 14% of their yearly IT budget onto cybersecurity, which is around $20M to $50M per year for a large
           scale company. In turn, there is a growing trend in the amount of job positions being created in the cybersecurity industry, as there is an ever increasing need for professionals.
           Paired with most companies willing to spend generously to protect data, many cybersecurity jobs are high-paying, with most positions going above $100k a year.
        </p>
      <h3>How will this affect you? </h3>
        <p>In terms of how cybersecurity will affect my daily life, and those around me, I would say that it will be greatly beneficial to how I interact on the internet. As when it comes to
           our own confidential information, it can be hacked at any moment’s notice, which could be comparable in the same way our house can be robbed at any time. Therefore, quick, decisive
           action needs to be taken in order to protect ourselves. I can invest in measures that help protect the information that I have, usually anti-virus softwares or firewalls that filter
           safe data, suspicious data and malicious data. These significant technological advancements in cybersecurity throughout the years mean that I will be more confident on the internet,
           knowing that there is a lessened risk of threat and attack.
        </p>

        <p>However, I acknowledge that even with powerful applications designed to protect us and our families from cyber attacks, it is good to still understand that there are certain attacks
           that can bypass those said security measures, I must learn to educate myself in other ways to protect myself from digital threats, such as creating a secure password, carefully analyzing
           emails for potential scams and generally being cautious of everything.
        </p>

  <div class="profilesection">
        <h3 class="sectiontitle">Blockchain/Cryptocurrencies</h3>
          <h3>What does it do?</h3>
            <p>Since the introduction of Bitcoin in 2008, blockchains and cryptocurrencies have been quick on the rise to popularity. Since then, many more coins/tokens were made, with
               some popular ones being: Ether (ETH), XRP, Cardano (ADA) and some branded as “memecoins” such as Dogecoin, which is based on the “Doge” meme circulating back to early 2010s,
               which consists of a Shiba Inu dog accompanied by random text. With many more to come, it is good to understand what they mean for society today, and possible effects it will
               have on our daily lives.
             </p>
             <p>A block is a collection of data/records stored digitally. Hence, a blockchain is a chain of multiple blocks that stores information electronically in a digital format. Blockchains
                are the technology that essentially enable cryptocurrencies to exist. The innovative aspect with blockchains is that they assure the security of a record of data without a need for
                a central clearing authority. They differ from databases in the way the data is structured, blockchains are decentralized and collect data in the form of blocks and link them together.
                On the other hand, databases are often centralized, where a central authority handles the actions in the database and structures their data in the form of tables. While this way can be
                quicker in most cases, it is ultimately more costly and lacks the security that blockchains have.
            </p>

             <p>Cryptocurrency, in its simplest form is digital money that is bought and sold online, no need for traditional paper bills or coins, it is not based on a physical asset such as gold and
                silver, and it doesn’t go through financial institutions like banks. Instead, cryptocurrencies operate in a fully decentralized system that uses blockchain technology to track transactions.
                Some benefits of using cryptocurrency as a payment method is that it is free from any third party interference, which is why crypto transactions never fail. Moreover, it is very easy to
                use it, through signing up for a digital wallet of crypto and start buying and trading straight away. Cryptocurrency can not only be bought but also “mined”. In the context of Bitcoin,
                mining is done by advanced computer systems that try to solve a difficult computational math problem, afterwards, the first computer to solve it will receive the next block of bitcoin.
             </p>

             <p>As of 2020, the global cryptocurrency market is worth at USD$1.44 billion and with the COVID-19 pandemic in place, people stuck at home have found their way onto crypto trading for the
                very first time in hopes of making a fortune at this perilous time period. However, as quickly as an individual can strike gold, it can be as quick to go bankrupt.
            </p>

             <p>A notable cryptocurrency scam that has been trending as of lately are “rug pulls”, which is when a crypto project (usually a coin or token) is heavily promoted/pumped up in value before
                the developers abandon the project and essentially run away with everyone’s money, leaving the coin with little to no value. This type of scam was responsible for over $3 billion lost for
                victims in 2021 according to Chainanalysis, a blockchain platform.
            </p>

             <p>An example of a fairly recent rug pull is the “Squid Game” crypto coin, which is based on the Netflix South Korean TV Series. Using the hype at the time to their advantage, developers of the
               Squid coin rushed to promote their project which in turn soared in value as thousands of investors bought tokens without much thought. The coin was valued at around $2,800 at its peak, an
               increase of 23million percent, but all came crashing down to less than less than 1 cent in a span of a few minutes. Numerous investors lost their hard-earned cash as the project was ditched
               by the developers and ran away with millions of dollars.
             </p>

          <h3>What is the likely impact?</h3>
            <p>Cryptocurrency has had a severe impact on global relations and the general economy of the world. It is safe to say that it has steadily established itself as a feasible currency and form of
               investment, but is not ready to be accepted by most people. As of 2022, there are over 15,000 cryptocurrencies in existence, and a little over 100 million people in the world own some form of crypto.
            </p>
            <p>There is no doubt that cryptocurrency is widely recognised at a global level and can either pose an opportunity for wealth or a threat for certain companies and even countries. Nine countries
              (Egypt, Iraq, Qatar, Oman, Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Bangladesh, and China) currently have a complete ban on the use of cryptocurrency, along with 42 others who placed implicit bans on the idea.
              The main reasoning behind this is that, it is said that crypto can be used in a variety of illegal ways such as: money laundering, fraud, drug trafficking, human trafficking, child exploitation,
              and funding criminal organisations. Criminals favor crypto over other forms of payment because while transactions on the blockchain are public record, the identities of those people who make the
              transaction remain unknown and therefore harder to track by government authorities.
            </p>

            <p>However, putting aside the possible drawbacks of cryptocurrency, the benefits far outweigh them. Blockchain technology has proven to improve economies in a number of ways according to Pelicoin.com:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>Blockchain has improved financial institutions’ cross-border transactions.</li>
              <li>Cloud computing can use Blockchain to execute smart contracts and resist hacking.</li>
              <li>Government and public records can use Blockchain to reduce paperwork and fraud while increasing accountability.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>All in all, cryptocurrency generally has had a positive impact globally, allowing everyone regardless of situation to
               freely trade internationally, thus creating an “economic equality”.
            </p>

          <h3>How will this affect you?</h3>
            <p>In terms of how the vast world of cryptocurrency will affect my daily life, I would say it would not affect me at all. I have gotten into trading crypto around the start of 2021, starting off with
               serious projects such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, making small profits through day trading. I eventually found some projects that were classified as memecoins, a cryptocurrency that has no discernable
               purpose.
            </p>

            <p>Most notably, Dogecoin, after noticing all the hype around this coin on Twitter, I decided to invest some of my “throw-away” (around $200 AUD) money for fun. In April of 2021, thanks to hype from
               Tesla founder, Elon Musk, the price of Dogecoin surged 400% in just one week. At the time, making it top 5 for highest-valued cryptocurrencies. A little over a month later, the coin passed the 50c
               mark, which marks over a 20,000% increase in just one year.
            </p>

            <p>On May 8, 2021, before Elon Musk’s appearance on Saturday Night Live (SNL) a lot of hype once again grew for the coin, that is when I sold over $3900 worth of my previously bought Dogecoin just before
               the drop in value, where it dropped 34% from 70c at the start of the show to just below 40c the following morning, a total drop of 45% and $35 billion in lost value. After that encounter, I quickly
               realized how volatile cryptocurrency really is, how it can make you a millionaire in mere moments, but can also all come crashing down due to greed. As of 2022, I have no current investments in cryptocurrency
               but am also aware that it is the future, and will eventually need to prepare for a world dominated by it.
            </p>

          <h3 class="sectiontitle">Cloud, Services, Servers</h3>
            <h3>What does it do?</h3>
              <p>Cloud services allow for the remote use of computational power rather than using a local serveror personal computer. The state of the art of this technology is the ability to be able to usepowerful resources
                 without physically owing them. Instead of purchasing and maintaining aserver on your own with capabilities that you may or may not need, instead you pay for a servicethat suits your needs specifically, If you
                 suddenly require more computing power or morestorage, you ask and pay for more, or if you don’t need as much power or storage you can savemoney and pay for less. In comparison to a local server, if these
                 issues arise it can be moreproblematic changing hardware and performing upgrades/downgrades for yourself, unless youknow exactly what you’re doing.
              </p>

              <p>As of today's technology cloud services can be utilised toperform the same tasks that local servers and personal computers can perform, except they areremote and are owned by exterior companies, examples of
                 use cases are data backups, disasterrecovery, email, virtual desktops, software development and testing, big data analytics, andcustomer-facing web applications. These are the basic and popular uses for the
                 use of theseservices. Some of the companies that provide these services include: Microsoft Azure, AmazonWeb Services(AWS), Google Cloud, IBM Cloud and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. Anotherexample is Google
                 Stadia, which takes advantage of cloud computing in order to allow users toplay games without the need for a powerful computer or dedicated console to play it on.
              </p>

              <p>Features that they are advertising is for users to be able to play games anywhere where they have astable internet connection, whether it be on a phone, tablet or tv. They also are
                 boasting thatusers will never need to download anything, no game downloads or updates. Cloud computing isutilised here to access the required hardware and software to run the video games and streamthe
                 output to users on their device. The technology that is used for services such as GoogleStadia will continue to advance and in the near future companies may not even own personalcomputers. For example
                 at RMIT cloud services are used to complete large workloads onsubjects such as genomic sequencing that would be usually too large to run on regular servers.
              </p>

              <p>In the near future, it is likely to see cloud services improve by allowing more storage that will becheaper and faster, this also relies on the ever improving storage technology that is becomingfaster,
                 cheaper, more reliable and secure. It will also improve as IoT does as they complimenteach other greatly, with cloud computing allowing the IoT a centralised server that containsresources that can be
                 utilised whenever needed which allows for real time control and datamonitoring. With the help from other rapidly advancing technologies, Gartner predicts that by2026 public cloud spending will exceed
                 45% of all enterprise IT spending, up from less than 17%in 2021, directly demonstrating the ability of cloud and its ever growing uses for the future. Theadvance in other technologies such as wireless
                 communications will allow for the cloud to beused in a broader way, enhancing the experience of some use cases such as mobile bankingand healthcare transformation, making these services becoming more
                 used in everyday life fornot just people who work in IT but everyone that uses technology.
              </p>

            <h3>What is the likely impact?</h3>
              <p>The potential impact of the development of this technology is that it will allow companies andusers to utilise powerful hardware in an extremely cost effective way. Without the need topurchase physical
                 hardware, installation, proper conditions for the hardware and continuedmaintenance, they pay for what is needed and don’t need any maintenance or installation. It alsoallows for much easier upgrades
                 as all they need to do is choose a different plan that gives morestorage or computing power. It is likely that because of this reason a lot of small businesses andstarting companies will take advantage
                 of these cost effective solutions in order to help grow theirbusiness before deciding to get a more personalised and better suited service with the use oflocal servers and hardware.
              </p>

              <p>People that will be most affected by this will be the head ofcompanies and their IT team, as to everyone else who only needs to use the email or website, itwill seem the same as a regular local server.
                 In terms of job creation, cloud services willsimultaneously create, replace and destroy jobs in the workplace. It will reduce the amount of ITworkers that will work within independent companies as they
                 will not need as many people tomaintain servers and hardware that they do not physically own. On the other hand it will createjobs for the same people to help maintain these servers at the external company
                 that is providingthe cloud services to the independent companies that are utilising their hardware. Thistechnology will replace local servers and hardware for some companies, which can allow forsaving
                 money or using it for other areas of the business that may need the funds.
              </p>

            <h3>How will this affect you?</h3>
              <p>The effect that this technology will have on me will be little to none, as I do not work withservers, although this may be because of the difficulty that comes with setting up andmaintaining a server,
                 with cloud services it will remove this reason to not own one makingme more likely to use a server through the technology of cloud services. Other aspects indaily life where this would be used could
                 be through Entertainment. With the growth ofservices such as Google Stadia, cloud gaming could become the standard for gaming in thefuture. This can affect me in many ways as I currently play video
                 games on my personalcomputer and instead I will be able to play the same games on any screen and not need touse the hardware of my computer. Some games also use cloud services to host theirservers.
              </p>

              <p>Not many games use the cloud to run their servers but in the near future it willbecome more frequent. When users play games that use these servers it may not seem anydifferent than local servers, meaning
                 that it doesn’t affect the users experience allowingcompanies to save money on servers and focus on other features of the game. It could alsobe used to run a media centre, allowing TV shows and movies to
                 be accessed all from onespot with a service such as Plex, it would also allow friends and family to access this serverto be able to watch and consume media without having to subscribe to various
                 differentstreaming services. The effect that this may have on my family members is that it may allowfor them to expand and start on their businesses giving them the features that a server canprovide for
                 them while being cost effective and secure.

          <h3 class="sectiontitle">Robots</h3>
            <h3>What does it do?</h3>

              <p>There are 5 types of robots they come in all shapes and sizes to efficiently carry out the task forwhich they are designed to do.</p>

              <h5>Pre-programmed robots</h5>
              <p>Pre-programmed robots operate in a controlled environment where they do simple,monotonous tasks. A great example of pre-programmed robots is mechanical arms onan automotive assembly line putting cars together.
                 The robotic arm serves one functionranging from welding a door on, inserting a certain part into the engine, or even carryingcars to another position. The reason for the pre-programmed to serve one function is
                 that it will perform the task for a much longer period as well as being faster, consistent,and therefore efficient in comparison to a human.
              </p>

              <h5>Humanoid robots</h5>
              <p>humanoid robots are robots that look can have the potential to mimic human behavior.These robots usually perform human-like activities such as jumping, running, or carryingobjects, and are sometimes designed
                 aesthetically to look like humans, by doing so, therobots will sometimes have human faces and expressions. Examples of humanoidrobots in today's society are the prominent video of ‘Hansons Robtoics’ Sophia’
                 wherethey have engineered and created a robotic head with a human face that is able toexpress feelings based on the user's verbal interaction with ‘Sophia’.

              <h5>Autonomous robots</h5>
              <p>Autonomous robots operate independently of human operators. These robots areusually created with the intention to carry out tasks in open environments that do notrequire human supervision or control. Autonomous
                 robots are different in comparison toother robots as they operate with sensors around the body to perceive the world aroundthem, they also have employed decision-making structures controlled by a computer totake
                 the optimal next step based on their data and intentions. An example ofautonomous robots that live in today's society are cleaning bots such as ‘Roombavacuum cleaners, which use sensors to roam freely throughout
                 a home, anotherexample of these robots are autonomous drones that are able to continue flying andmove around on their own within a targeted location.
              </p>

              <h5>Teleoperated robots</h5>
              <p>Teleoperated robots are semi-autonomous bots that are used on a wireless network toallow humans to control from a safe distance. These robots are usually seen to work inextreme geographical weather, conditions,
                 and circumstances. There are numerousexamples of teleoperated robots being used around our world, for example, these robots are able to fix underwater pipe leaks during an oil spill by a human-controlled submarine,
                 another prime example are the drones used by the military to detect landmines on abattlefield.
              </p>

              <h5>Augmented Robots</h5>
              <p>Augmented robots either enhance the current human capabilities or replace thecapabilities a human may have lost. Although this field of robots has yet to unravel thetrue potential of enhancement. Scientists are
                 hypothesizing that bots have the ability toredefine the definition of humanity by making humans faster and stronger. There aresome examples of current augmented robots such as prosthetic limbs or basicexoskeletons
                 that are utilised to lift heavy weights or carry heavy objects from A to B.
              </p>

              <p>Robots are all around us and we unintentionally interact with them despite us realising it is evena robot to be with, as we have made robots to talk to us, listen to us, perform as asked, andeven solve problems
                 without specific direction from humans. For example, siri or any sort ofdevice A.I that interacts with us is considered being a robot, for that instance, we are evolving tocreate robots that are responsive with
                 the help of artificial intelligence to create a full physicalinteraction between us and the robot. The most common use for robots involves them being analternative for human labor, doing work that humans could
                 do but doing it better as they are notfragile in comparison to humans.
              </p>

            <h3>What is the likely impact?</h3>
              <p>The potential impact of having robots in the future coming years is critical as it will aid us into anew age of time where we are able to enhance our daily lives and the environment that's aroundus. For example,
                 augmented robots that are used in humans can help speed the process ofproductivity and work safety on factory floors. With environments, we are able to speed theproduction resulting in other projects commencing
                 faster.
              </p>
              <p>With that being said, the impact on employment rates will critically decrease per robot added tothe workspace, per 1000 workers are due to be replaced. Jobs in office administration, logistics,and transport are
                 at risk of being replaced as there are systems and robots that can do theirjobs within hours or quicker in comparison to humans that do it in days. People who drive as ajob also may risk being in the position of
                 getting replaced as autonomous vehicles are beingimplemented by ‘Teslas’ feature of having ‘hands-free’ driving. Overall we are likely to see in thetimes coming half of all low-skilled jobs be taken over by robots.
              </p>

              <p>Robotics in public spaces for security will also be impacted and have new and improvedtechnologies to enhance crimes from being committed. For example, artificial technology willonly get better from now on as more
                 upon more data will be able to gather in the future,therefore, creating a reliable prediction of face recognition. The impact of security can also beseen through automatic recognition of suspicious activities as it
                 has been seen to work withincamera-based security systems.
              </p>
            <h3>How will this affect you?</h3>
              <p>The most likely impact that robots will have on my personal life is the convenience they will be infor my daily lifestyle. Robots will be able to assist my daily livelihood in multiple ways whether itbe how quick
                 ill be able to do my task or to the extent of having more time to myself, asautonomous vehicles may be implemented in the future I will be able to get to my destinationquick as the vehicle will come on time or won't
                 leave later than it should, alongside havingrobots to do chores that I should be doing such like the ‘Roomba’.
              </p>

              <p>Having robots be a big part of my life, it'll be able to change a lot, in terms of having a new wayof living without having to do tedious tasks will help give me more time to myself to do othertasks that are more
                 important, additionally having small tasks to be taken care of will inevitablylift up built-up stress therefore as a result will help my mental health in the long run as I won'thave chores to fit in within my schedule.
                 Alongside having autonomous robots to do chores inmy daily life, ultimately eliminate tasks that could potentially harm me, for example getting asore back or slipping and hurting myself.
              </p>

              <p>How robots can help aid my family is through the use of augmented robotics, as my parents getolder to the point of being unable to move as frequent anymore or even having impairedfeatures such as listening or their
                 vision decreasing, augmented robotics can help them byenhancing or repairing their features with robotic elements to regain their loss bodily functions.Another way robots can help my family is through automotive vehicles
                 due to my parents beingold and fragile, they are unable to drive their own vehicles as it is a risk factor. Instead, they'll beable to use an automotive vehicle to get from A to B with only a few buttons to press to get
                 to their destination and not having to use any of their bodily functions, which is a perfect way to getthe elderly across places.
