                    The idea of this project is for an app that operates similarly to Uber Eats. Instead of allowing users to order food,
                    this app will instead allow users to order items from stores that use our service. Users can order at any time of the
                    day provided there is a delivery driver working at that time. The process of a worker will involve driving to a shopping
                    centre/store, picking up the item, and then delivering it to the customer. A mapping algorithm could be built to
                    create an efficient and cheaper delivery system for both the user and the driver. This would also be used to calculate
                    the total delivery fee which factors in the distance between the store and the delivery address at that current point in time.
                    This will of course need to update in real time which will result in higher fees during peak hour for example. Using
                    this as the payment model means that a driver cannot increase their income by delivering slower. For this app to work
                    there needs to be some restrictions on the user. For the convenience of the driver, a limit of five items from a maximum
                    of two stores should be allowed – however, this will be subject to change depending on user feedback from the drivers and
                    customers. There is nothing stopping a customer from ordering through multiple drivers at once but they will of course
                    have to pay the base and a delivery fee for each order. There will also need to be a limit on the weight and bulkiness of
                    an item. A user cannot have a washing machine delivered for example. This service is not here to replace one's weekly shop.
                    If there were to be a partnership with retailers, there needs to be a decision on how this service is monetized.
                    Uber Eats charges a 30% commission to the restaurant for every single order (Ridester, 2022). While this does keep the costs
                    down for those ordering, it’s not exactly pro-business. The pricing model is one of the more difficult aspects of this idea to
                    settle on. The pricing needs to provide a balanced outcome for all parties. The driver needs to be paid well enough, the service
                    fee must be reasonable, and the profit margins need to be enough to keep an idea like this afloat. The user will have to pay a
                    base fee as well as a rate that adds up by the minute. For the efficiency of the service, users will buy the item through the
                    retailer rather than having the driver make the purchase. This however, does bring up the issue with the security of the
                    purchase. Drivers could easily steal an item they’re supposed to be delivering. This isn’t as much of an issue with food
                    delivery services as food deliveries may be worth double digits at most. To prevent or at least limit this, drivers will need
                    to provide ID and a possibly a background check when creating an account.

                    At this stage of developing this idea, the group has created a prototype of the app. The prototype gives a good idea
                    of the base features that will be included in the app. It also serves as a reference that can be used as the group
                    further develops this idea. The prototype was created using Figma which allowed us to develop different screens with
                    different functions. Figma allowed us to essentially create a mockup that we could follow and use as a guideline when
                    developing the application and its features. Almost all the features relating to the app can be viewed from the
                    prototype. While these features haven’t yet been developed, they still give a reasonably good idea of the app's final
                    outcome. The design of the app will vary based on the type of user. Apart from the app and the database, there are
                    three main features that will need to be developed for the delivery driver. This includes an algorithm to allocate a
                    job based on the driver's desired shift length, an integrated GPS map, and a QR code generator that stores information
                    relating to each order. For the customer, features include an integrated map that is used to track a delivery, and an
                    order progress status that automatically updates in real time. The features for each store will involve the storage and
                    presentation of their sales data. Much like the view for the customer, the retailer will be able to view details for
                    each order including its current order status.

                    This particular idea was not thought of until Assignment 2 and did not branch off any of the ideas that were suggested
                    in Assignment 1. Initially, the plan was for an app that can be used to ship items across a city on demand. This app
                    would operate similar to the current proposed idea with similar features. This was soon scrapped as it was decided
                    the potential market for an app like this would be limited. It did however serve as a precursor to the current idea.
                    Having finished a User-centred Design assignment, some of our group members had the idea for a shopping related app.
                    Using this as an initial starting point when brainstorming for app ideas, our group soon came together on the idea of
                    an app that would allow for its users to be able to order different products from different stores, which can be
                    delivered to them all through a single app. This stemmed from group members describing their own personal shopping
                    experiences and the group discussing how this entire process could have been made easier. Our group believed that the
                    accessibility and ease this provides would be appealing to a large target audience. From here we began to slowly
                    implement features into our idea that we figured were ideal, such as being able to order from different stores via
                    different shopping centres. Once we had finalized the app idea, the next challenge was to determine the method of
                    prototyping. Initially we had planned to use Bubble Editor, which is a no-code application developer. Due to research
                    from Assignment 1, we discovered that React Native is a common tool used to build applications however upon further
                    inspection we realized that attempting to learn and use React Native could prove extremely difficult especially given
                    the limited timeframe. This led us to choosing Bubble Editor as our application builder.  After communicating with
                    our tutor we discovered that screenshots were ideal when displaying our prototype. Having just finished a UCD
                    assignment that also required some prototyping, the group decided that we could use Figma to present our prototype.
                    This would allow for us to be as creative with our screenshots as we want to. We would then expand our idea by using
                    Bubble Editor for the actual building of the application. We also planned for our Figma screens to act as a guideline
                    when we build our prototype. Since we are in such early stages of our application development, we haven’t really yet
                    set a concrete development plan. Ideas, plans, and our development techniques are changing so often that planning far
                    ahead into the future does not seem to be reasonable.
