                <p>
                    Our group 'The Heard', from the past few weeks have been following certain roles that suit the tasks they have been assigned to.
                    This includes completing different sections of the project and assignment, for example:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Florenz Bacting(s3943864) was our formatter and quality checker, as he was responsible for assessing our sections that other group
                    members send in. Which is vital to keeping each member of the group’s work to a high standard and at the expectations that need to be met.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Aaron Zacharia Mathew (s3944964) was our organiser for meetings whilst also completing his section within the assignment, which is important
                    as it keeps all members in the current progress cycle.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thomas (s3953864) was our aims and progress tracker, which was significant to the group as he kept every member in check whilst also providing
                    a review of our progress.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Cooper Siliato (s3942975) was our technology and tester, being able to give descriptions of different technologies that will be used in the
                    project provides a sense of clarity on how they benefit in developing our project. Being a tester also aids the group and project as his input
                    on how the testing will be completed allows the project and group member’s work  to be further improved upon.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Vo Dat Pham(s3947255) was our jobs and skills identifier, which was important to help the group identify the different skill sets and job types
                    that would be needed to develop the project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Aldric Xavier Lim (s3949508) was our roles identifier whilst also aiding the development of the website as well. Having this was important to
                    the group as it helped solidify the types of delegated tasks placed onto group members.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the last week of the project assignment, there were no specific roles assigned anymore, instead general tasks were assigned to everyone,
                    such as each member of the group creating a screen prototype of our application. Each member of the group also helped other team members with
                    their section of the assignment, eventually leading to all members adapting different types of roles. This is to ensure that bits and pieces of
                    our project are patched up.
