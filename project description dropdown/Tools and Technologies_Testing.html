                    <p>
                        The web based prototyping tool Figma will be used, this will be utilised to create prototypes and
                        mockups for the design and interface of the application. The standard version of Figma is needed and
                        the project will not require the paid version. All members of the group are familiar with this tool
                        as it has been used previously to create mockups and designs for a user interface.
                        Github will be used to allow for collaboration on code and a place for version control, while also
                        hosting a website, github has also been used previously for previous assignments and the group is
                        familiar with it.

                <h3> Testing </h3>
                    <p>
                        Various testing methods can be used to gain insight into what best suits the product or to find
                        out which features work well and which do not. For example A/B testing, this will allow for the
                        testing and feedback of two or more designs simultaneously to find out which of them is the most
                        successful, whether it being the difference between certain colours or location of buttons and
                        menus, this will help finalise the design of the application. The project utilises the agile
                        model for the development process allowing for testing between each iteration of the product,
                        this allows for constant and immediate feedback which will continue to improve the product as it
                        continues to be developed. In order to find users for user testing acquaintances of the group
                        members would be used, whether they are friends or family, out of these people the ones that
                        suit the target audience would be most appropriate and asked to participate in testing the
                        product. An appropriate amount of people for testing would be between 5 and 15, this allows for
                        a spread dataset while also not taking up too much time, if there was more than 15 users
                        testing, it would produce more accurate data but would take up too much time and resources for
                        it to be useful, but less than 5 users will not produce enough data to be considered useful.
                        There will be several types of users that will be used to test the product as different users
                        will be using the service for different needs. For example as a customer to purchase goods and
                        have them delivered, or as a delivery driver to find jobs and deliver goods, or as a shop owner
                        to have people buy off their store page and have it delivered to them.
