            <div class="profilesection">
                <h3> Aim </h3>
                    <p>
                        The intended outcome for this project is to create a working app and then eventually a computer application.
                        This is obviously unrealistic considering the time frame given, but the project will be worked on with the
                        intention of a finished and fully-functioning app. To achieve this, there are a number of components that will
                        need to be completed. For one, a database will need to be programmed to store the customer’s and the driver’s
                        information. In addition to this, the database will store the retailers that use our service, as well as their
                        respective products. An algorithm will also need to be programmed so the drivers can be presented with the
                        most efficient route to the delivery addresses. These components will make up the app/website - that of which
                        will need to be designed, prototyped, and then tested.
                    </p>
                <h3> Build the Database </h3>
                    <p>
                        The database will be developed using either MySQL or SQLiteStudio. These relational database management systems
                        already have some familiarity to the group. The database will store information relating to the delivery driver,
                        user, and the stores that are using this service. The information relating to the delivery driver includes their:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Account details (i.e. email address, password, and first and last name) </li>
                        <li> Delivery history (i.e. delivery routes with their respective date/time) </li>
                        <li> Distance traveled  - to calculate pay </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        The information relating to the user includes their:
                        <ul>
                            <li> Account details (i.e. email address, password, and first and last name) </li>
                            <li> Order history (i.e. items ordered, and the delivery routes with their respective date/time) </li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The information relating to the store includes the:
                        <ul>
                            <li> Stores that use our service </li>
                            <li> Items that are available via our service (includes all store items, except those that are bulky) </li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Whenever a user makes an order, the info on the order will need to be added to a database. Each order is assigned
                        with a generated QR code. This can be presented by the delivery driver, and scanned at the store of the order -
                        adding to the efficiency of this service. When scanned, the QR code will display the items included in the order.
                    </p>
                <h3> Program an Algorithm </h3>
                    <p>
                        This app will require an algorithm serving two purposes - maximizing efficiency and preventing long wait times.
                        For the sake of profit and efficiency, the driver will be required to deliver to multiple addresses during a
                        single job. An algorithm that can instantly process the quickest route will minimize delivery times and thus,
                        will minimize the cost of the delivery - benefiting both the users and delivery drivers, and increasing profit
                        margins. Other postal services do use these routing algorithms for the same reasons. Another important feature
                        that is necessary for the algorithm is the ability for it to adapt in real time. The generated route needs to
                        take into account roadworks, accidents, or any other disruption that could affect travel time. The GPS navigation
                        app Waze is particularly good at this. Waze picks the fastest route based on traffic conditions such as accidents,
                        construction, police, road closures, and other disruptions. The mapping model should be based on that of Waze’s.
                        The driver will need to allow their location at all times so that they can be tracked by the customers. Each job
                        will be randomly assigned to a driver meaning they have little to no say in where they go on the job. The reason
                        for this is to prevent customers from waiting for a delivery. We don’t want a customer to have to wait hours because
                        drivers have just happened to not select that specific customer. As waiting times increase for a customer, the
                        chances they will be assigned to a driver will increase - thus preventing longer wait times. The algorithm that
                        generates the shifts for the driver will need to make sure the total time of the entire delivery process does not
                        exceed the driver's desired shift length.
                    </p>
                <h3> Create the app/website </h3>
                    <p>
                        It’s obvious that an app of this sort is going to take inspiration from apps for other delivery services. The app
                        itself needs to be efficient for users to use and incorporate the necessary features for all types of users.
                        The whole idea is that we provide ‘same-day delivery’ for selected items from selected stores. Customers want
                        their items fast and part of that is providing a user experience that is easy and efficient to use. The app is
                        going to take inspiration from other similar apps so that the user has some familiarity with it and its features
                        - even if they’re using it for the first time. Upon entering the app, we want to make sure the user has all the
                        necessary features at their fingertips whether they’re a customer, driver, or retailer. Customers will immediately
                        be presented with some featured stores they can shop from; drivers will be presented with a screen from which they
                        can immediately begin a shift of a desired time; and retailers will see their store rating and their sales/order data.
                        At this stage, the group is only focusing on designing an app. However, we plan on creating a website and then eventually
                        a computer application. This would be a more viable option for a store especially when they’re receiving multiple orders
                        at one time.
