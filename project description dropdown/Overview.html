<h1>Overview</h1>
  <h2>Topic</h2>
  <p>DRIVN® is a software application developed by “The Heard” that is designed to provide shoppers with extremely fast same-day delivery from certain shops which can be categorized by location (such as Highpoint, Chadstone, Pacific Werribee). The app will be intended for iOS and Android devices, and will have a similar concept to UberEATS (customer account, driver account, store account).
The outcome, if successfully finished, is that our application will hopefully include a fully furnished friendly user interface (in adherence to UCD principles), which will provide a bug-free experience to our users (customers, drivers and stores alike).</p>
  <h2>Motivation</h2>
  <p>Our team’s motivation behind starting this project is a result of creating a faster, more efficient to order items in the local area from certain shopping centers instead of resorting to other ways such as “fast-fashion” websites like Shein, ASOS, etc. which from the general viewpoint may be an easier way, but it will not have any advantages for the domestic community. Additionally, new jobs are created as customers order from local businesses, the community’s profits are reinvested back into the economy. Lastly, by choosing to buy locally, environmental impacts are significantly reduced:</p>
  <p>A reduced carbon footprint (less greenhouse gases are generated. Less carbon dioxide is released to the atmosphere. Reduced cardboard use as well as reduced use of jet fuel/ship fuel.</p>
  <h2>Landscape</h2>
  <p>An obvious application/system that share the same characteristics with our idea is Uber and UberEATS, especially the latter. However, while our systems may be similar, we have an entirely different target audience, as UberEATS aims to deliver food/groceries to individuals. We aim to target another market, those who are shopping fanatics, as we deliver items from stores that are within shopping centers such as Highpoint and Chadstone. We believe this is better for the economy compared to delivering food, as the average price of orders will be averagely higher, which will stimulate the local economy more effectively.</p>
