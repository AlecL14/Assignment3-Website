                      Our application requires the access of many different store databases, however we run the risk of being denied access to certain databases which would
                      in turn affect which stores we could display  on our application. Our group also runs the risk of not being able to achieve every desired feature for
                      the application as bubble editor is a no code application developer meaning there might be some limitations as to what it can achieve in regard to
                      designing certain features.

                    <p>
                      For Assignment 3 our group used two forms of communication, we would have online meetings scheduled in Microsoft Teams and we would also have meetings in
                      person during our Tutorial session. We would use our online meetings as a primary source of communication, in which we would discuss everyoneâ€™s current
                      progress, any changes required, any deadlines we have set and what the next steps are moving forward. We would also communicate through the chat system
                      outside of meeting times such as when a member has completed their section or if any members have any queries. If we have a group member that does not respond,
                      then we would firstly attempt to contact them through other channels other than Microsoft Teams such as RMIT email. If the group member still failed to
                      communicate after this, then we would contact our tutor as the next step to inform them of the group members inactivity.
