            <h2>Scope and Limit</h2>

            <div class="profilesection">
                <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <p>In terms of limits, as we only have 6 weeks to work on this assignment, the deliverables can be very limited to Figma prototype screens
                    instead of a fully developed application that can work on mobile devices. Taking other factors such as economic and time constraints,
                    we would at the least need a few weeks of working on the project to progress further.
                    </p>
                <h3>Project Objective:</h3>
                    <p>Create a mobile application that allows the fast and efficient delivery of various items found in stores located within popular shopping centres </p>
                <h3>Resources:</h3>
                    <p>
                        Team leader(1), Development team(3), Development leader(1), Software tester(1)
                    </p>
                <h3>Deliverables:</h3>
                    <p>A list of Figma prototype screens that will give a basic overview of the application in terms of visuals, Full PDF Report outlining information
                        about the project, GitHub Pages website that will also outline the same information in the report.
                    </p>
                <h3>Out of scope:</h3>
                    <p>A fully furnished application that will be available on iOS and Android devices, a separate website that allows stores to manage their statistics</p>
