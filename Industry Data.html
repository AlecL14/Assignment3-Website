               languages. These could be used to develop websites, games, and databases.

          <h3 class="sectiontitle">Burning Glass Data</h3>
            <p> There were some surprises with the data, more specifically in the “Skills in Greatest Demand” from May 25, 2016 - May 24, 2017. It was unexpected seeing analytical skills so
                low down on the chart. It is also worth noting that the data is quite old in terms of the IT world. For example, certain skills may not need to be as important if AI
                has taken over a role that would usually be reserved for an employee.
                There were also some skills that weren’t in high demand, but were featured in the required skills of the ideal jobs. Decision making was a skill that was required for a Software
                and Applications Programmer.
                There were of course skills that were obvious in terms of where they were positioned. Communication skills ranked 1 by a long way. This skill is crucial - especially
                in a job that requires team work/collaboration. IT is a field that requires you to work with other people - whether that be internal or external.
