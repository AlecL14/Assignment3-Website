                <h3> Web Developers </h3>
                    <p>
                        To be able to operate the website, we’ll need to have website developers as they will allow
                        functionality to be usable throughout the website. Web developers plan, produce, and maintain
                        websites using web programming languages, software applications, technologies, and databases
                        together with user needs specifications. As we will require web developers, it is crucial to include
                        within wed developers the back-end, full-end, and full-stack developers to make the whole website
                        run properly.
                    </p>
                <h3> Back-end Developers </h3>

                        Back-end developers will create the structure of the website, write code, and verify the code works.
                        Their responsibilities also may include managing access points for others who need to manage a
                        website's content.

                        see and interact with. The developers will design the physical layout of each page, integrate
                        graphics, and use HTML and JavaScript to enhance the site.
                    </p>
                <h3> Full-stack Developers </h3>

                        these developers have the knowledge to build a complete website and may work for a smaller
                        business that does not have the budget for a more extensive website team. Which would be perfect
                        for what our group will be dealing with.
