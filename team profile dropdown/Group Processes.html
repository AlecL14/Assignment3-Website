              <p>Despite being behind by about two weeks or so, we managed to efficiently assign roles to team members regarding the specific tasks that they were to do.
                 Set due dates to those tasks and made sure that we divided up the work fairly. Keeping organized and attending team meetings that discuss the assignment,
                 which is a good way of keeping in touch on our progress in each of our individual assigned tasks. An improvement that could be implemented in A3 is our time
                 management, as we did not start A2 until about a week before the due date, therefore we had to cram work in a short period of time.
