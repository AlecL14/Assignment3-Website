            <div class="profilesection">
                <h3>Thomas Avery</h3>
                    <p>Thomas Avery's ideal job is a Software and Applications Programmer, whose main tasks are to design/develop code,
                        maintain it and modify it to satisfy user needs (situation-specific). This role usually requires at least a Bachelor’s Degree
                        (or higher) in computer-related fields as well as relevant work experience which can also assist in his position.
                        This role differentiates from the others in the way that it requires advanced knowledge in BOTH software and hardware,
                        which means that Thomas will have to be involved in front and back-end development.
                    </p>
                <h3>Florenz Bacting</h3>
                    <p>Florenz Bacting’s ideal job is an Associate Gameplay Engineer, whose main tasks are to work with animators to create gameplay systems,
                        supporting the design department through generalist tasks, game optimization and bug fixing. Excellent skills in C++ are required,
                        as well as fluency in 3D mathematics, outstanding communication skills as well as adequate knowledge in video games.
                        This role differentiates against the other jobs in the way that it is the only one that is in the “video game development” industry,
                        as well as a requirement in 3D mathematics which is assumed to be part of the gameplay development.
                    </p>
                <h3>Vo Dat Pham</h3>
                    <p>Vo Dat Pham’s ideal job is a Website Administrator, whose main tasks are designing, developing, maintaining and troubleshooting websites,

                        web administration as well as this is the only role that is leaning towards being a “web developer.”
                    </p>

                <h3>Cooper Siliato</h3>
                    <p>Cooper Siliato’s ideal job is a Graduate Software Developer, whose main tasks require working with others, in designing and developing software,
                        maintaining/monitoring systems and solving any problems that may arise. This role requires a Bachelor’s Degree (or higher) in Computer Science or
                        other related courses, as well as fluency in a variety of programming languages such as Python, JavaScript, Java, C#, C, C++, etc.
                        This role differentiates from the others in the sense that while programming knowledge is needed, the company is willing to train Cooper in other
                        languages that may be needed for the job.
                    </p>
                <h3>Aldric Xavier Lim</h3>

                        ‘professional Machine Learning Engineer role’ or at least a ‘combined Data Engineering and data science experience with cloud-based ML platform’ as
                        well as requiring the applicant to keep up with advancing ideas about machine learning and technologies. This differentiates to the other roles in
                        the way that since it is a Senior position, it needs at least 5+ years of experience in a similar role.
                    </p>

                <h3>How similar/different are the career plans?</h3>
                    <p>Generally speaking, the career plans/ideal jobs are fairly similar, as they all require at least a Bachelor’s Degree in the computer field.
                        The ideal jobs also lie around in the areas of being a developer, the only distinguishable difference is front end/back-end development.
                        The two jobs that really stand out from the rest is Alec’s Senior Machine Learning Engineer and Vo’s Website Administrator.
                        Alec’s position leans towards more of supervising other developers as well as working on the Data Science and ML Platform.
                        Vo’s position revolves around web programming instead of developing applications and software.
