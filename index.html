                <p>My name is Aldric Xavier Malanog Lim (or Alec), my student number is s3949508. I'm a first-year student at RMIT University currently studying a
                Bachelor's of Information Technology. In my pastime, I like to play video games, watch TV series and sports such as the NBA, and also playing
                basketball. My interest in IT is the idea that you can utilise a computer to build and develop many different types of applications through
                programming. Which leads to my interest in IT happening when I found out what my dad's job was but also being around various types of technology
                growing up, pushing me to become curious as to how these technologies worked. My IT experience involves a one-week work placement (Willis Towers Watson)
                where I was working within the IT department inputting data into a broking application, I was also able to learn about their servers and how they maintain it.

                <p>My name is Florenz Ovel Bacting (or “Ovel” for short), my student number is s3943864 and currently a first-year student at RMIT University studying
                Bachelor of Information Technology. During my pastime, I enjoy playing video games, researching historical events and watching sports such as NBA and AFL.
                At a very young age, I immediately became very fascinated in how various technologies work, how they were made, how to operate them and how it directly
                affects the world we live in right now through having access to my first ever personal computer as well as gaming console (PS3) in the late 2000s. In terms
                of IT Experience, I worked in a coordinated retail store environment over a one-week work placement period (Aftershock PC) during Year 10 where I assisted
                as a member of hardware repair as well as customer service, throughout this time I acquired a basic understanding of the hardware aspect of computers.

                is Australian, my culture is Indian, and I am currently a first-year student at RMIT doing Bachelor of Information Technology. In my free time I enjoy
                playing video games, playing piano, watching tv shows, playing basketball and watching Formula 1. I am interested in IT as I believe it to be a great
                field that will experience growth soon. My interest in IT began during year 12 as I was figuring out which direction to head in for a career. After
                doing some research and speaking to some friends and family I found that IT would be a field that would have great value in the future.

                <p>Cooper Siliato, s3942975. I am 19 years old, born in 2003. My nationality is Italian and Australian, with Italy being from my dad’s side of the family.
                My spare time consists of playing guitar, watching anime, playing video games, and watching or playing sport (AFL, Soccer, Basketball). My interest in
                IT consists of how modern technology can be used in order to solve problems, simple or complex. My interest in IT started from a young age, playing video
                games on a playstation 2 and browsing the internet on the family computer. Watching minecraft youtube videos is what ultimately made me want to get my own
                custom pc which further increased my interest in IT by allowing me to use my own pc freely while also opening up the pc and installing and upgrading hardware.

                <p>My name is Thomas Avery but I usually go by Tommy. I was raised in Adelaide before coming to Melbourne to pursue my university studies. IT had always been
                an interest of mine as I had always been around computers as well as learning various aspects of IT during my primary and high school years. IT had also
                branched out into some personal hobbies of mine including playing video games, and fixing or upgrading software and hardware. I eventually want a job in a
                field that I enjoy which is why I decided to study IT. The aspects of IT I enjoy most is programming. I learnt a bit of Python and HTML in year 11 and I doubt
                I would be doing this course had I not done this. I can only see the IT industry getting bigger in the future.

               My interest in the topic of IT as a whole started all the way back when I was a child just the website flash games on the pre-made computers from office works.
               Although I spend too much time on the computer, it sparked an interest in the generality of computers and how these machines operated, as years progressed, I've been
               surrounded by my sisters who constantly used technology one way or the other, exposing me to a lifestyle of technology, to the point that recently I've built my own computer.
