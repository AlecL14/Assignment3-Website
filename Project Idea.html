  <h2>Project Idea</h2>

    <div class="profilesection">
        <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>DRIVN® is a software application developed by “The Heard” that is designed to provide shoppers with extremely fast same-day delivery from certain
             shops which can be categorized by location (such as Highpoint, Chadstone, Pacific Werribee) The application will allow customers to place orders from a
             variety of shops in certain shopping centers and the application will designate a driver to pick-up those certain items and deliver it to the customer
             straight away. Ultimately, the goal of this application is to provide individuals who may not have access to transportation the freedom to shop as if
             they were in the mall themselves, as items ordered will be received almost instantly. Moreover, it enables small businesses to be discovered as their
             shop will be seen on the app, essentially giving them exposure to a wider range of potential customers.
           </p>
    </div>

    <div class="profilesection">
        <h3>Motivation</h3>
          <p>The motivation behind this project idea is mainly a result of trying to create a faster, more efficient way to order items without needing to order
             it internationally. Through customers ordering from local businesses, the economy is stimulated. Thus, new jobs are created and the close community
             gains revenue, as the money is going straight back into the community’s pocket. Economic prosperity among local businesses means a higher standard
             of living for the wider society, as taxes go back to improving public services among the community.The motivation behind this project idea is mainly a

             public services among the community.
          </p>

          <p>Additionally, by choosing to buy locally, this means that there is a reduced carbon footprint (the total amount of greenhouse gasses that are generated
             by our actions) as energy required to transport goods often uses fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas. They also release carbon dioxide into the earth’s
             atmosphere, which can contribute to global warming.
          </p>

          <p>Buying locally have positive side effects such as:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Less cardboard use as compared to international shipping.</li>
            <li>Reduced use of fuel (either from aircraft or ships).</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Statistics show that the transport sector contributed the release of 83 million tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere in 2009, an amount predicted
             to reach 104 million tonnes by 2030.
          </p>

          <p>“Statistics show that the transport sector contributed the release of 83 million tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere in 2009, an amount predicted
             to reach 104 million tonnes by 2030.” - Australian Government Department of the Environment.
           </p>

          <p>Therefore, I strongly believe that pursuing this project idea will generally have a positive impact in our society, predominantly the small, local
             businesses that are still trying to recover from the devastating impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the various environmental benefits it
             can bring, as a result of buying from local sources.

        <h3>Description</h3>
          <p>In further detail, DRIVN® is a mobile (iOS, Android) application that is available for free for everyone. However, it mostly targets teenagers and young
             adults who are interested in shopping. Once DRIVN® is opened, the user is given options to set up an account or proceed as a guest. The app will then ask
             the user to allow for their location to be used. Once that has occurred the app will provide the user with a list of different shopping centers near their
             location in alphabetical order. The user is also provided with a search bar near the top for them to search up their desired shopping location rather than
             having to scroll through the list. Once the shopping center has been selected the user is provided with another list which contains all the different stores,
             in the specific shopping center they chose, in alphabetical order. The user is also given the option to be able to search up their desired store at the top.
             Following this the user is able to view all the specific products and goods from the store they chose and are able to add it to their shopping cart.
             Once it has been added they are able to proceed with the payment process and if they would like to they can save their payment details for future purchases.
             Once the payment process has been completed the user will be given notifications throughout the rest of the process such as when the driver has collected
             the order and when the driver has arrived at the users location.
          </p>

          <p>Some functional requirements that the application will include are:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Users can connect their credit/debit card to the app.</li>
            <li>Users can select which shopping centers they would like to purchase from.</li>
            <li>User can switch over from different shopping centers if they are unhappy with their current selection.</li>
            <li>The user is able to set the location which the driver is meant to deliver the orders to.</li>
            <li>Notifications, the app can send notifications to the user if given permission, such examples can be: if the order has been placed, if it is ready
                for pick up by the driver, if the driver has picked up the orders, and if the driver has arrived at your location.</li>
            <li>Users can view their checkout cart to inspect their desired items.</li>
            <li>Users can create an account to use within the app or proceed as a guest.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Some non-functional requirements that the application will include are:</p>





          <p>Development for the application will be created following  a Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) model called “Agile”, which essentially breaks down
             the product into small incremental builds that are provided in iterations. With each build, more and more features are added through software updates that
             will improve user experience and functionality. An advantage of this model is that it:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Is a realistic approach in developing software.</li>
            <li>Encourages teamwork across all members of the team.</li>
            <li>Developers are not overwhelmed by having to release every feature at once (gives them more flexibility).</li>
            <li>Appropriate for either fixed or rapidly changing requirements.</li>
            <li>Gives development team adequate time to adapt to situations that arise.</li>
            <li>Keeps all team members aligned on the project instead of having different team members completing different tasks simultaneously.</li>
            <li>Can deliver early prototypes of the program, which allows for the analysis of the pros and cons and how they can be improved or fixed.</li>
            <li>User feedback can be used to implement further improvements in updates.</li>
          </ul>

    <div class="profilesection">
        <h3>Tools/Technologies</h3>
          <p>This project will use the software React Native as an open source tool to develop code. Which will be used to create the interface of the mobile
             application. React Native is similar to React in terms of its code making it easy to learn whilst also having a huge community of people that are
             willing to help if need be. Since this is a mobile application, React Native enables the app to be cross-platform which allows it to run on both
             IOS and Android. It will also use Firebase, which is used to pair with the user interface. This project would require the collection of all the
             different store API’s to be able to list and store the different stores' individual item prices into our database. The project would also require
             the use of Google Maps API which would allow for the app to collect the users location which would be needed for the delivery of the ordered goods.
             This project will also require the utilization of Github for version control so that the team will be able to commit changes to the project whilst
             also keeping the entire team informed and up to date. We would also require an iOS and Android device, to test the application and identify bugs to
             quickly apply updates to.
           </p>

    <div class="profilesection">
        <h3>Skills needed</h3>
          <p>Various skills are needed in order to complete this project, these range from technical, communication, collaboration and critical thinking skills
             each playing a vital part in the completion of the project.
          </p>

          <p>Technical skills will help with the development of the product, specifically with the areas of the project that require knowledge of the technology
             that is being utilized in the product. These skills could include:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Programming in various languages.</li>
            <li>Knowledge of software/app development.</li>
            <li>Project management.</li>
            <li>Data analysis.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Since the project is using React Native to develop code, the knowledge of programming in the language of javascript will be needed. Javascript is a
             programming language that is used by developers all over the world to develop dynamic and interactive web content such as apps and browsers. Javascript
             also allows for access to multiple platforms including IOS, android and windows, making it a perfect language for app development. Swift can also be
             used to program if the app will be IOS exclusive as Swift is a programming language that was created by Apple and will not work on other devices.
             Swift focuses on its simple and expressive syntax allowing it to be easily understood making it easy to learn and use.
          </p>

          <p>Communication and  collaboration skills are also vital for a project to be successful. These skills will help people work together effectively, making
             completion of work faster, better and with less interruptions or disputes. Example of these skills are:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Active listening and open-mindedness of others ideas.</li>
            <li>Giving each other trust and respect.</li>
            <li>Providing constructive feedback and criticism.</li>
            <li>Being self-aware of yours and others actions.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Critical thinking skills in a project is important as it relates to all aspects of the project whether it being tasks, situations, topics, challenges or
             opportunities, it is a general thinking skill that can relate to anything and therefore be a very important skill to have. These skills include:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Observation .</li>
            <li>Analysis.</li>
            <li>Inference.</li>
            <li>Communication.</li>
            <li>Problem solving.</li>
          </ul>

      <h3>Outcome</h3>

          <p>In hindsight, we thrive for both businesses and consumers to receive their purchase in the quickest manner possible and in order to do so, a new wave of
             employment is opened as a result of DRIVN®. Through the process of DRIVN®, we utilize local citizens within the community to work based on their own agenda
             to deliver purchases to users who have bought from shopping centers which ultimately benefits the communities economic flow and environmental footprint as
             previously mentioned.
          </p>

          <p>DRIVN® aims to be the main middleman by utilizing the majority of social platforms to help benefit all sides through the transaction, for example DRIVIN®
             will help consumers to broaden their variety of choices without wasting time, along with having the quickest form of delivery. As a result of this, business
             owners will gain a lot of viewers from the broader attraction that DRIVE® will bring along due to the publicity from the amount of platforms used.
